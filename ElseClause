  // ifstatement and ElseClause were together but you need ifstatement to have a ElseClause. 
  // "else if" is a statement between if and else.
  // The ElseClause is always opposite the statement, the example of myBool which works with ElseClause.
  // If there are only two outcomes, meaning true or false that you can use for ifstatement. If there's more than two outcomes, don't use ifstatement that becomes else if.
