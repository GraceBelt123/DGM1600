// Parameter is technically a variable, sometime, can be called a field
// If statement is public which can be seen by other classes because its access modifier is public. 
// If there's a parameter that resides in a function, that parameter is local to that function. 
// This int _h is local to this function and is used to calculate things. If you were to say our health, which is public that is +=, will be however much h to health I think.
// First, to make a public function. Second, To type this as void. Third, the parameters within called "AddHealth." Fourth, the parentheses with opening and close curly braces.
// Replacing it with these two values, the parameters are to perform whatever local things the function needs. 
// For example, "Print" is a function that accepts parameters. 
// If you want to update, is a parameter that the class can see. If it's public or other option. 
// UI is a class and reference type yet it's made by Unity.
